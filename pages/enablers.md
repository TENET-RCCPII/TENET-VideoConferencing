teaser: "Throughout history academic institutions has been divided into cohorts consisting of either <em>academics</em> or <em>support staff</em>. We prefer to call support staff <em>enablers</em> and to help them become part of the research or teaching and learning team."

## What is a research enabler?

Research enablers are those people who might not be employed in an academic position within a tertiary
education and research institution, but still play a major role in making research happen. Research enablers 
can include staff in:

- IT
- libraries
- research support office
- admissions
- electronic services
- archives
- communication
- human resources
- facilities 
- and more...

## Why should we talk about enablers?

Very often the impact of work done by people in support positions is not communicated properly. 

<em>For example</em>: No research into cures for cancer, or solutions for world hunger, poverty, and global 
warming would be possible without internet access for our researchers.

By putting a little bit more emphasis on the impact of providing proper internet at a university, might
lead to higher levels of motivation and inspiration amongst IT networking staff. By sharing more information 
about the types of work that are being enabled through connectivity, these folks might take more ownership of
the research outputs from their institutions.

Not only could this lead to a more positive working environment and attitudes amongst support staff, but 
it may also lead to better relationships between support staff (enablers) and academics. By emphasising the 
role that support staff play to enable research, academics may find better ways to collaborate with support
staff to enhance their research.

## What can enablers and academics expect this year?

We will be running various sessions in 2018 to assist with building 
bridges between academics and support staff in 2018. We look forward to hearing your suggestions and feedback.

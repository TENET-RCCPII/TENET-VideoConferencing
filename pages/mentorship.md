## Monthly Carpentry Instructors Meetups

Since 2017 a monthly meeting has been running where Carpentry instructors from Africa come together to discuss recent or upcoming workshops, lessons learned, opportunities, challenges, and more. These sessions will continue to run under the umbrella of the RCCP II Capacity Development Initiative in 2018/2019.

Please sign up to participate by visiting [our Etherpad]()http://pad.software-carpentry.org/ZA-community-call. Participation open for anyone in Africa who has attended a Carpentry instructor training workshop.

## Pre-workshop Mentoring Sessions

The Carpentries Task Force will provide support to instructors and helpers who will be teaching/helping at upcoming workshops prior to the events. Task force members will assist with preparation of lessons, general questions about the Carpentries teaching methodologies, code of conduct, and more.

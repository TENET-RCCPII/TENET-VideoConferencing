## About Carpentry Instructor Training

> Over the last hundred years, researchers have discovered an enormous amount about how people learn and how best to teach them. Unfortunately, much of that knowledge has not yet been translated into common classroom practice, especially at the university level.
>
>This two-day class has the following overall goals:
>
>    Introduce you to evidence-based best-practices of teaching.
>    Teach you how to create a positive environment for learners at your workshops.
>    Provide opportunities for you to practice and build your teaching skills.
>    Help you become integrated into the Carpentry community.
>    Prepare you to use these teaching skills in teaching Carpentry workshops.
>
>Because we have only two days, some things are beyond the scope of this class. We will not be learning:
>
>    How to program in R or Python, use git, or any of the other topics taught in Carpentry workshops.
>    How to create your own lessons from scratch (although you will have a good start on the principles behind that sort of work if youâ€™re inspired to learn more).

## What is happening in South Africa?

Over the past three years more than 60 South African researchers, students, as well as IT and library 
staff have participated in local instructor training events.

The first instructor training event for 2018, funded through <em>RCCP II</em>, ran from 21 - 23 February
in the Western Cape. More information is available at [the event's website](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/2018-02-21-South-Africa-ttt/).RCCP II will fund another in-person workshop in September/October 2018 and again in March 2019. There are also opportunities to run in-house instructor training events if your institution can fund it. Alternatively South Africans can get access to online instructor training.

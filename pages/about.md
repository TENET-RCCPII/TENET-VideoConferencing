## Background

Vidyo is a videoconferencing platform that was developed to address some of the problems that traditional videoconferencing has. These problems lie particularly in the ability of these approaches to easily scale between meeting rooms, the desktop and laptop computer environment and using mobile devices and the ability to have many participants in a meeting without sacrificing quality. Vidyo is able to do this in part by virtue of the fact that its VidyoRouter does no encoding, re-encoding or compositing – all the activity relating to these activities takes place on the end point devices – leveraging the power of modern computing devices.

Endpoints in Vidyo can range from high end room systems with multiple screens through to setups that are similar to traditional videoconferencing setups, through to a PC with a conference camera/speaker/microphone device in a seminar room to an individual on a laptop to someone using a smart phone top connect over LTE or 3G.

Vidyo does not leave the traditional world of videoconferencing behind. TENET has put in place a number of Vidyo’s VidyoGateways that allow H.323/SIP endpoints to join Vidyo meetings.

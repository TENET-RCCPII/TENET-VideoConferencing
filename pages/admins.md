TENET aims to support administrators at institutions who in turn supports the end-users. We hope that this website will alleviate pressure on institutional Vidyo administrators by providing guides, not only related to administrative issues, but also where admins can point there end-users to.

If you, as an administrator, have any ideas to make this website more useful, please create an issue on our website repository. Instructions for creating issues are [available here](https://github.com/TENET-RCCPII/TENET-VideoConferencing/blob/gh-pages/Contribute.md).

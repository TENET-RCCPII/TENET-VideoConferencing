			<summary>From 21 to 23 February 2018 researchers, postgraduate students, IT, and library staff will be able to learn how to teach programming at the fourth in-person Software and Data Carpentry Instructor Training workshop in South Africa.</summary>
			<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/rccpii-2018/carpentries/instructor/">&lt;p&gt;In 2016 and 2017 three Software, Data, and Library Carpentry instructor training events 
were run in South Africa. These train-the-trainers events were well-attended by researchers, 
IT staff as well as librarians. Participants came from a wide range of universities and companies from all over the country and even from other African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/&quot;&gt;Carpentry instructor training&lt;/a&gt; aims to teach those who can already use tools such as R, Python, Shell, Git, Matlab, and 
OpenRefine, to become better teachers of these tools. The Carpentriesâ€™ lessons are specifically aimed
at people who work in research settings. The training includes topics such as assessment, how learning works, how to organise and run a Carpentry workshop, and more. It does not teach the tools itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about Software, Data, and Library Carpentry, please see:&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>First Carpentry Instructor Training for 2018</title>
				<link>http://localhost:4000/rccpii-capdev-2018/carpentries/instructor/</link>
				<pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;In 2016 and 2017 three Software, Data, and Library Carpentry instructor training events 
were run in South Africa. These train-the-trainers events were well-attended by researchers, 
IT staff as well as librarians. Participants came from a wide range of universities and companies from all over the country and even from other African countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/&quot;&gt;Carpentry instructor training&lt;/a&gt; aims to teach those who can already use tools such as R, Python, Shell, Git, Matlab, and 
OpenRefine, to become better teachers of these tools. The Carpentriesâ€™ lessons are specifically aimed
at people who work in research settings. The training includes topics such as assessment, how learning works, how to organise and run a Carpentry workshop, and more. It does not teach the tools itself.&lt;/p&gt;

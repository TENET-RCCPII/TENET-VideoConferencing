# About this Website

The Rural Campus Connectivity Project I and II has been running since 2010. In 2018, we would 
like to create greater awareness of the project, specifically the Capacity Development elements
of RCCP II.

The project is funded by the Department of Higher Education and Training in South Africa.

Please get in touch if you can't find the information you're looking for or would like to get involved.

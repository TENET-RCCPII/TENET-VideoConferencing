With only six months left on the RCCPII grant, we are seizing the opportunity to visit universities such as Walter Sisulu
University (WSU), University of Fort Hare(UFH), as well as Durban and Mangosuthu Universities of Technology (DUT and MUT) and 
University of Zululand (UNIZULU).

Several staff members of these universities were nominated by their institutions to participate in the recently held
[CarpentryConnect JHB event](https://tenet-rccpii.github.io/rccpii-2018/carpentries/carpentryconnect/)
that was jointly funded through RCCPII and [SADiLaR](https://www.sadilar.org/).

The roadshow will include:

- presentations to IT, library, and academic support as well as researchers and lecturers about the RCCPII 
Capacity Development Programme
- follow up with CarpentryConnect participants about bringing Carpentry workshops and other teaching resources to their institutions
- follow up with recently trained Carpentry instructors to help them complete their certification
- follow up with other staff members about Carpentry workshops in planning
- sharing information about upcoming RCCPII events that are open to the various universities such as:

** Blended Learning SIG meeting on 19 & 20 November in Johannesburg

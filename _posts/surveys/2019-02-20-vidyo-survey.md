Are you often involved in online meetings or web conferences? Have you been using 
Vidyo? Do you use any other online meeting tools? What have been your
experience?


TENET is conducting a survey of its Vidyo video conferencing service. 
TENET has offered this service to its beneficiary institutions for the 
past four years and is now reviewing the service.

We have put together a short survey and invite you to provide us with feedback.

Click here to start the [survey](https://jisc.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/tenet-video-survey).

If you are not familiar with the TENET Vidyo service, please see

Thank you for completing the survey and providing us with your feedback. 
We appreciate the time you have taken and will actively use it to improve 
our service to you.
